Hi, I am a PhD student at the National University of Singapore. My research direction is trustworthy ML, which focuses on making machine learning models more transparent, robust, and fair. Currently, I am more interested in the **explainability** of neural networks. In other words, how to let a black box model **provide supporting arguments about its decision-making process**, or even further, train a model that is **inherently transparent**.

Prior to my PhD study, I finished my master's at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, where my subject was *Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence*. I spent a great time doing research at [CAMP](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/start/) (Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality). At CAMP, my research topic was about explainable AI and how to apply explanation methods on neural networks trained for medical purposes.

I did my bachelor's study at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, majoring in *Computer Engineering*. My final year thesis and research at the senior stage is about hardware security. Specifically, how to do logic encryption on chips.

I am devoted to making ML more applicable in our everyday life, enabling ML models in safety-critical scenarios like medicine, finance, and civil. During my part time, I enjoy traveling in different places, especially relaxing beside sea, and exploring the other side of our planet through diving.
