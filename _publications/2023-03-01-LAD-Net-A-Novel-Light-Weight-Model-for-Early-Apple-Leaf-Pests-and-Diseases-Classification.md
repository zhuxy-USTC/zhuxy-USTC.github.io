## Abstract
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Aphids, brown spots, mosaics, rusts, powdery mildew and Alternaria blotches are common types of early apple leaf pests and diseases. These pests and diseases severely affect the yield and quality of apples.
Recently, deep learning has been regarded as the best classification model for apple leaf pests and diseases. However, models with large parameters have difficulty providing an accurate and fast diagnosis of apple leaf pests and diseases on mobile terminals.
This paper proposes a novel and real-time early apple leaf disease recognition model. AD Convolution is firstly utilized to replace standard convolution, which reduces the number of parameters and calculations. Meanwhile, a LAD-Inception is built to enhance the ability of extracting multiscale features of different - sized disease spots. Finally, the LAD-Net model is constructed by the LR-CBAM and the LAD-Inception modules. Global average pooling is used to replace a full connection, further reducing parameters.
The results show that the LAD - Net, with a size of only 1.25MB, can achieve a recognition performance of 98.58%. Additionally, it has a delay of only 15.2ms on HUAWEI P40 and 100.1ms on Jetson Nano. This illustrates that the LAD-Net can accurately recognize early apple leaf pests and diseases on mobile devices in real-time, providing portable technical support.
