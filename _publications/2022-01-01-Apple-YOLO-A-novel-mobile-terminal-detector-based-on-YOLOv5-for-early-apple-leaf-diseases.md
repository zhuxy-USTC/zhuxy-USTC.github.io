## Abstract
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper presents Apple-YOLO, a novel mobile terminal detector based on YOLOv5 for early detection of apple leaf diseases. The proposed method improves upon the original YOLOv5 architecture by incorporating mobile-specific optimizations and early disease detection capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Apple-YOLO achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed compared to existing mobile detection methods for agricultural applications.
