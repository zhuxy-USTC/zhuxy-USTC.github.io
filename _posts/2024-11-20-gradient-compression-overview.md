As deep learning models continue to grow in size, distributed training has become essential for reducing training time. However, the communication overhead between nodes can become a significant bottleneck. This is where gradient compression comes into play.

## What is Gradient Compression?

Gradient compression techniques aim to reduce the amount of data that needs to be communicated between nodes during distributed training, without significantly impacting model convergence.

## Common Approaches

### 1. Sparsification
Only transmit the most significant gradients, typically the top-k largest values.

### 2. Quantization
Reduce the precision of gradient values (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit).

### 3. Error Feedback
Accumulate compression errors locally and add them to future iterations.

## My Research Focus

In my current research, I'm exploring chunk-wise gradient sparsification combined with pipelined communication to achieve better compression ratios while maintaining model accuracy.

Stay tuned for more technical details and experimental results!
