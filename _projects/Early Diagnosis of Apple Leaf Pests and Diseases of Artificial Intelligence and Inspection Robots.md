<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim</h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Design a lightweight deep learning pipeline that identifies early-stage apple leaf pests and diseases with high accuracy.</li>
<li>Deploy the optimized model on Jetson TX2 and integrate it with an autonomous inspection robot for in-orchard monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸ““ Project Content</h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Collected field images covering eight early-stage apple leaf diseases and expanded the dataset ~12Ã— through digital augmentation to support robust training.</li>
<li>Adopted Mosaic augmentation and proposed the Apple-CSP lightweight module to improve recognition of small lesion targets while keeping the network compact.</li>
<li>Introduced asymmetric dilated convolution and the LAD-Inception structure, leading to LAD-Net and ALS-Net models that balance accuracy, speed, and parameter count.</li>
<li>Ported the models to Jetson TX2 and collaborated on a wheeled inspection robot with remote monitoring, autonomous navigation, and cloud data synchronization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸª¨ Project Difficulties</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Key challenges encountered during the project included:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Capturing sufficient early-stage disease imagery under natural light while maintaining dataset diversity and quality after augmentation.</li>
<li>Preserving detection accuracy for tiny lesions despite aggressive lightweighting required for edge deployment.</li>
<li>Achieving stable hardware-software integration on the resource-constrained Jetson TX2 platform, including navigation, perception, and cloud connectivity for the inspection robot.</li>
</ul>
